Vim support for Reason/OCaml
=========================================

This is a version of [Reason](http://facebook.github.io/reason/) Vim editor integration without needing OPAM or dynamically loading the plugin. The only things you need are the 3 binaries described [here](http://facebook.github.io/reason/jsWorkflow.html#javascript-workflow-editor-setup-global-utilities).

Installing
------------------

If you are using a plugin manager, add a line such as the following to your `.vimrc`:

```
" If using NeoBundle
NeoBundle 'chenglou/vim-reason'

" Or, if using Vundle
Bundle 'chenglou/vim-reason'

" Or, if using Vim-Plug
Plug 'chenglou/vim-reason'
```

Formatting
===========

The command `:ReasonPrettyPrint` invokes the binary `refmt` which must be available on your `PATH`.

You can set `g:vimreason_extra_args_expr_reason` to control the arguments
passed to `refmt` (such as `--print-width`). The contents of
`g:vimreason_extra_args_expr_reason` is a string that contains a `VimScript`
expression. This allows you do dynamically determine the formatting arguments
based on things like your window width.

```vim
" Always wrap at 90 columns
let g:vimreason_extra_args_expr_reason = '"--print-width 90"'

" Wrap at the window width
let g:vimreason_extra_args_expr_reason = '"--print-width " . ' .  "winwidth('.')"

" Wrap at the window width but not if it exceeds 120 characters.
let g:vimreason_extra_args_expr_reason = '"--print-width " . ' .  "min([120, winwidth('.')])"
```

Key Mappings
=============

You can create a custom function and map it to a keybinding (in your `.vimrc`)
to quickly trigger formatting, and control how the formatting occurs. To enable
keymappings *only* for `reason` files, your vim must have been compiled with
`+localmap` (`:echo has('localmap')` should output `1` if your vim supports it).

For example, the following maps `cmd + shift + m` to reformat only when editing
a `reason` file.

```vim
autocmd FileType reason map <buffer> <D-M> :ReasonPrettyPrint<Cr>
```

Merlin
===========
We come with [Merlin] support by default. You can check the features [here](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/wiki/vim-from-scratch#discovering-the-shiny-features). Skip the installation procedure in that page; this plugin doesn't use it.

[Syntastic](https://github.com/vim-syntastic/syntastic) support is unobstructedly enabled here by default. [Neomake](https://github.com/neomake/neomake) support can be enabled by setting `let g:neomake_reason_enabled_makers = ['merlin']`.

LICENSE
-------
Some files from VimReason are based on the Rust vim plugin and so we are including that license.
